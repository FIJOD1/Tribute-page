      <h2 id="headline">Biography</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>13 June 1954</strong>:
          Okonjo-Iweala was born in Ogwashi-Ukwu,
          Delta State, Nigeria, where her father, Professor Chukwuka Okonjo, was
          the obi (king) of the Obahai Royal Family of Ogwashi-Ukwu.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1961 - 1973:</strong>
           Okonjo-Iweala was educated at Queen's
          School, Enugu; St. Anne's School, Molete, Ibadan; and the
          International School Ibadan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1973 - 1976</strong>
           She arrived in the US as a teenager to
          study at Harvard University and graduated magna cum laude with an AB
          in Economics
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1981</strong>- she earned her PhD in regional economics and
          development from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the
          thesis Credit policy, rural financial markets, and Nigeria's
          agricultural development
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>25-years career at world bank</strong>- Okonjo-Iweala had a
          25-year career at the World Bank in Washington DC as a development
          economist and rose to the second position, managing director.As
          managing director, she had oversight responsibility for the World
          Bank’s $81 billion operational portfolio in Africa, South Asia,
          Europe, and Central Asia. Okonjo-Iweala spearheaded several World Bank
          initiatives to assist low-income countries during the 2008–2009 food
          crises and later during the financial crisis. In 2010, she was the
          chair person of the IDA replenishment, the World Bank’s successful
          drive to raise $49.3 billion in grants and low-interest credit for the
          poorest countries in the world.During her time at the World Bank, she
          was also a member of the Commission on Effective Development
          Cooperation with Africa, which was set up by Danish Prime Minister
          Anders Fogh Rasmussen and held meetings between April and October 2008
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>15 July 2003 – 21 June 2006 - </strong>During her first term
          as Finance Minister in the administration of President Olusegun
          Obasanjo, she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club that led to
          the wiping out of US$30 billion of Nigeria's debt, including the
          outright cancellation of US$18 billion.In 2003, she led efforts to
          improve Nigeria’s macroeconomic management including the
          implementation of an oil-price based fiscal rule. Revenues accruing
          above a reference benchmark oil price were saved in a special account,
          the "Excess Crude Account," which helped to reduce macroeconomic
          volatility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>21 June 2006 – 30 August 2006 - </strong>Following her first
          term as Minister of Finance, she served two months as Minister of
          Foreign Affairs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>17 August 2011 – 29 May 2015</strong>- In 2011, Okonjo-Iweala
          was re-appointed as Minister of Finance in Nigeria with the expanded
          portfolio of the Coordinating Minister for the Economy by President
          Goodluck Jonathan. Her legacy includes strengthening the country's
          public financial systems and stimulating the housing sector with the
          establishment of the Mortgage Refinance Corporation (NMRC).She also
          empowered women and youth with the Growing Girls and Women in Nigeria
          Programme (GWIN); a gender-responsive budgeting system, and the highly
          acclaimed Youth Enterprise with Innovation Programme (YouWIN); to
          support entrepreneurs, that created thousands of jobs. As part of
          Goodluck Jonathan's administration, she received death threats and
          endured the kidnapping of her mother. This program has been evaluated
          by the World Bank as one of the most effective of its kind globally.
          Under her leadership, the National Bureau of Statistics carried out a
          re-basing exercise of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the first in
          24 years, which saw Nigeria emerge as the largest economy in
          Africa.She took a lot of heat for the government's fuel subsidy
          removal policy, an action that led to protests in January 2012. In May
          2016, the new administration eventually removed the fuel subsidy after
          it became apparent that it was unsustainable and inefficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2015–2016</strong>- After leaving government, Okonjo-Iweala
          became a member of the International Commission on Financing Global
          Education Opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>January 2016</strong>- she became the chair-elect of the Board
          of Gavi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2019 - 2020</strong>- Since 2019, Okonjo-Iweala has been part
          of UNESCO's International Commission on the Futures of Education,
          chaired by Sahle-Work Zewde. Also since 2019, she has also been
          serving on the High-Level Council on Leadership & Management for
          Development of the Aspen Management Partnership for Health (AMP
          Health). In 2020, the International Monetary Fund's Managing Director
          Kristalina Georgieva appointed her to an external advisory group to
          provide input on policy challenges.[51] Also in 2020, she was
          appointed by the African Union (AU) as special envoy to solicit
          international support to help the continent deal with the economic
          impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1 March 2021</strong>- Okonjo-Iweala was unanimously appointed
          as the next Director-General on 15 February. She began her career as
          Director General of the WTO.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2021</strong> - Okonjo-Iweala was appointed as co-chair,
          alongside Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Lawrence Summers, of the High
          Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on financing the global commons for
          pandemic preparedness and response, which had been established by the
          G20. In July 2021, she joined the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on
          COVID-19 Vaccines, Therapeutics, and Diagnostics for Developing
          Countries, co-chaired by Tedros Adhanom and David Malpass.
